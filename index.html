          <h3 class="title">About me</h3>
          <p>
            I was born on <strong>08/04/1997</strong>, in Bahia Blanca,
            Argentina üá¶üá∑. In 2001 I moved to San Marino üá∏üá≤, and I'm currently
            living here. Since I was a kid, technology and computers have always
            attracted me, so I always wanted to become an hacker üìü. Then, by
            growing up I realized that I really enjoy
            <strong>building things</strong> which really works and can be used
            by people, in particular if it is an app, a service, or a website
            etc. This passion led me to choose to study Computer Science, to
            start to understand how to really build those things. <br /><br />My
            first dream was to be like Mark Zuckerberg (ok I know it's trivial
            but he's cool), and probably that was because I watched the movie
            <a

              >The Social Network</a
            >, which is still my favourite one. <br /><br />To be short,
            <strong
              >I want to create something special, something that can really
              change people's lifes, and create it with technology, and I know
              that someday I will do it.</strong

          <h3 class="title">A little bit more about me, my studies and my works</h3>
          <p>
            I started studying
            <strong>Information and Communication Technology</strong> in High
            School at Morciano Di Romagna, and when I finished it, in 2016, I
            found a job as a <strong>Web Developer</strong> at
            <a target="_blank" href="https://mr-apps.com">Mr. APPs</a>, a web
            agency based in San Marino. I worked there for 3 years and it was
            awesome, because I had the opportunity to learn a lot of things,
            like designing a website or developing a mobile application.
            <br /><br />
            Also in 2016, I enrolled at the University of Urbino Carlo Bo to
            deepen my knowledge on ICT. On <strong>26/09/2019</strong>, after 3
            years of course, I got my
            <strong>Bachelor Degree in Applied Computer Science</strong> with
            the final mark of 97/110. ü§ì <br />So basically, I got a degree while I was working and applying my
            studies on real projects day by day. And yes, I can say that it was
            great.
            <br /><br />
            In October 2019, I left my job as a web developer, because I wanted
            to get more knowledge and experience in a different environment, so
            I started working as a full stack developer at
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.botika.ai/">Botika</a>, a
            startup based in San Marino which develops things using
            <strong>AI</strong>, <strong>machine learning</strong> and other
            cool stuff.
            <br /><br />
            In October 2020, I left my job as a full stack developer (yes, again) at Botika. This was a year of big changes and some new opportunities came to me. Botika helped me a lot to learn new things and I gained a lot of experience just in one year. Now, it's time to step up again, and I decided to move to Milan. I'll start my career as a Freelancer and my goal is to open my own company in a few years. For now, I'm going to work as a CTO in a startup called <a href="https://italian-artisan.com" target="_blank">Italian Artisan</a>, check it out if you want.
