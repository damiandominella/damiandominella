                <h3 class="title">About me</h3>
                <p>
                    I was born on <strong>08/04/1997</strong>, in Bahia Blanca, Argentina ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡·. In 2001 I moved to San
                    Marino ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡², and I'm currently living here. Since I was a kid, technology and computers have always
                    attracted me, so I always wanted to become an hacker ðŸ“Ÿ. My first goal/dream was to work at Google
                    (because I watched the movie <a target="_blank"
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Internship">The Internship</a> ðŸ˜Ž) or more generally in
                    the Silicon
                    Valley. But by growing up, I realized that I really want my own billion tech company ðŸ¤‘ and so this
                    is
                    my goal now.
                </p>

            <article>
                <h3 class="title">Studies and work</h3>
                <p>
                    I started studying <strong>Information and Communication Technology</strong> in High School at
                    Morciano Di Romagna, and when
                    I finished it, in 2016, I found a job as a <strong>Web Developer</strong> at <a target="_blank"
                        href="https://mr-apps.com">Mr.
                        APPs</a>, a web agency based in San Marino. I worked there for 3 years and it was awesome,
                    because I had the opportunity to learn a lot of things, like designing a website or developing a
                    mobile application.
                    <br /><br />
                    Also in 2016, I enrolled at the University of Urbino Carlo Bo to deepen my knowledge on ICT.
                    On <strong>26/09/2019</strong>, after 3 years of course, I got my <strong>Bachelor Degree in Applied
                        Computer Science</strong> with the final mark of 97/110. ðŸ¤“
                    <br /><br />
                    So basically, I got a degree while I was working and applying my studies on real projects day by
                    day. And yes, I can say that it's great.

                <h3 class="title">Some nerdy things</h3>
                <p>
                    I've said that I worked for 3 years as a Web Developer and so I used a lot of languages and
                    frameworks like <span class="italic">Javascript, Typescript, PHP, HTML, CSS/SCSS, Angular, React,
                        NodeJS...</span> and (unfornately ðŸ˜…) I also know really in depth some Content Management
                    Systems like <span class="italic">Prestashop and Wordpress</span>. I worked as a frontend and
                    backend web developer equally in these years, so I have a huge knowledge on Web Development.
                    <br /><br />
                    I'm also a huge fan of <strong>AI/AR and Machine Learning</strong> and I'm going to learn these
                    things soon.
